# schwartz-order

I've started a new version of this project at [burger-time](http://github.com/irisfaraway/burger-time). Consider this an attempted prototype.

Sometimes at work we order burgers from Schwartz Bros. We could write everything down or use a spreadsheet. But why not do it with Rails instead?

Still to come:

- order form
- stats
- data visualisation
- http://nthitz.github.io/turndownforwhatjs/
